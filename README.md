# VILS

Short for _Very Intelligent Language System_

## About

VILS was created and inspired by JARVIS.
But also I wanted to make a cool and complex Java application.

This is version 2.0.0, version 1.0.0 was operational and it turned out really good
but unfortunetely I had an accident with my Windows OS and the project code was lost.

Why, you might ask?
The code wasn't hosted on Git since it was an Eclipse-based java project and publishing
that on Git is a horror. 

So this time, I decided to avoid Eclipse and IDE all togather and go with Ant project.

## Project setup
